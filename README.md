# Yard AI Extended

# What is this?
A small tool for the game Railroader.

### This mod is deprecated - last supported Railroader version is 2024.3.1
An excellent upgrade is peterellisjones' SmartOrders: https://github.com/peterellisjones/Railroader-SmartOrders

Adds more "Distance" buttons when using Yard Mode (AI Engineer).
v1.1 adds an option to change the desired speed when using Yard Mode (AI Engineer).
Maximum yard speed is increased to 25 mph, derailments will still be your responsibility.

# How to install?
You will need to get Zamu's Railloader from https://railroader.stelltis.ch/, install following the instructions there.
When that is done, drag this .zip onto Railloader.exe.

# What about multiplayer?
Should work fine in multiplayer, host does not need this installed to work.
