# Yard AI Extended

# What is this?
A small tool for the game Railroader, to add more "Distance" buttons when using Yard Mode (AI Engineer).

# How to install?
You will need to get Zamu's Railloader from https://railroader.stelltis.ch/, install following the instructions there.
When that is done, drag this .zip onto Railloader.exe.

# What about multiplayer?
Should work fine in multiplayer, host does not need this installed to work.
